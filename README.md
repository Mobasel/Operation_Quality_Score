# Operation Quality Score
#### In this project, we had a quality score sheet for an operation department containing a record per each monitored case.
- We got insights for some metrics, like: the average quality score for each agent, the average evaluation time, the average section score per agent, and each section average score.
- I cleaned the raw data and divided it into two sheets, and then, I used Microsft SQL Management studio to write the queries that are attached to the project.
- Then, I visualized the mentioned insights using Looker Studio & Power BI and measured some additional insights.
- The Raw Data: [rest_ops_2023_q1.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18944824/rest_ops_2023_q1.csv)
- Quality Sheet: [Rest_ops_quality.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18944873/Rest_ops_quality.xlsx)
- Sections Sheet: [Rest_ops_sections.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18944875/Rest_ops_sections.xlsx)
